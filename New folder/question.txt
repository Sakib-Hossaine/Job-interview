Implement different operations on a set s .

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the no of test cases . Then T test cases follow. The first line of input contains an integer Q denoting the no of queries . Then in the next line are Q space separated queries .
A query can be of four types 
1. a x (inserts an element x to the set s)
2. b (prints the contents of the set s)
3. c x (erases an element x from the set s)
4. d x (prints 1 if the element x is present in the set else print -1)
5. e (prints the size of the set s)

Output:
The output for each test case will  be space separated integers denoting the results of each query . 

Constraints:
1<=T<=100
1<=Q<=100

Example:

Input
2
6
a 1 a 2 a 3 b c 2 b
5
a 1 a 5 e d 5 d 2
 
Output
1 2 3 1 3
2 1 -1

Explanation :
For the first test case
There are six queries. Queries are performed in this order
1. a 1     { insert 1 to set now set has {1} }
2. a 2     {inserts 2 to set now set has {1,2} }
3. a 3     {inserts 3 to set now set has {1,2,3} }
4. b        {prints the set contents ie 1,2,3}
5. c 2     {removes 2 from the set }
6. b        {prints the set contents ie 1,3}

For the second test case 
There are five queries. Queries are performed in this order
1. a 1     {inserts 1 to set now set has {1} }
2. a 11   {inserts 11 to set now set has {1,11} }
3. e        {prints the size of the set ie 2}
4. d 5     {since five is present prints 1}
5. d 2     {since 2 is not present in the set prints -1}


Note:The Input/Output format and Example given are used for system's internal purpose, and should be used by a user for Expected Output only. As it is a function problem, hence a user should not read any input from stdin/console. The task is to complete the function specified, and not to write the full code.
